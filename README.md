# refactor-this-done instructions.

Project has been based refactored based on the on the SOLID principles.

* Separate Controllers for Product and ProductOptions
* Create based model class. e.g. 

class BaseEntity {
    // common fields e.g. ID, DateCreated, DateUpdated
}

and extend Product and ProductOptions classes from this BaseEntity.


* add ProductManager and ProductOptionsManager services classes into depedency injection in startup class.

* Inject the service classes into controller constructor to get access to use service methods.

# refactor-this
The attached project is a poorly written products API in C#.

Please evaluate and refactor areas where you think can be improved. 

Consider all aspects of good software engineering and show us how you'll make it #beautiful and make it a production ready code.

## Getting started for applicants

There should be these endpoints:

1. `GET /products` - gets all products.
2. `GET /products?name={name}` - finds all products matching the specified name.
3. `GET /products/{id}` - gets the project that matches the specified ID - ID is a GUID.
4. `POST /products` - creates a new product.
5. `PUT /products/{id}` - updates a product.
6. `DELETE /products/{id}` - deletes a product and its options.
7. `GET /products/{id}/options` - finds all options for a specified product.
8. `GET /products/{id}/options/{optionId}` - finds the specified product option for the specified product.
9. `POST /products/{id}/options` - adds a new product option to the specified product.
10. `PUT /products/{id}/options/{optionId}` - updates the specified product option.
11. `DELETE /products/{id}/options/{optionId}` - deletes the specified product option.

```
